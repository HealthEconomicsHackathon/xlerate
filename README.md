An experiment in turning an Excel file into an R program.  It takes as inputs an excel file (in xlsx format) a set of cell references as inputs and a set of cell references as outputs and returns a function that can be used to "execute" the excel workbook from R.  Currently only very basic excel operations are supported.



For example, [this excel workbook](inst/example/tree.xlsx) implements a tree model with inputs on the first sheet and outputs on the second.


```r
path <- system.file("example/tree.xlsx", package = "xlerate")
```

The inputs are on the first tab, making up a column with a few gaps, and with labels in the column to its left:

```r
inputs <- xlerate::xlerate_ref(
  c("D3:D13", "D15:D16", "D18:D21"),
  1, list(col = -1))
```

The outputs are all over the second sheet and have labels two rows below


```r
outputs <- xlerate::xlerate_ref(
  c("C40", "E34", "E50", "G29", "G38", "G45", "G54"),
  2, list(row = 2))
```

Then create a function that can generate these outputs


```r
tree <- xlerate::xlerate(path, inputs, outputs)
tree
```

```
## <an xlerate object>
```


```r
tree(c("pTST_pos" = 0.01))
```

```
